Overview

Note: To qualify for competition points and final prize, please submit your best model results and all relevant code and supporting materials before the competition ends.



Open-source projects form the backbone of our digital world, powering everything from developer tools to the largest blockchain ecosystems. Yet the question of how to distribute funding fairly and effectively across these projects remains a persistent challenge. Traditional grant-making systems rely on projects to proactively apply for rounds (only crying babies get fed). Even those applying in the rounds have to market themselves to a wide base or curry favor with a few decision makers, leaving core dependencies under-recognized, under-appreciated and under-funded.



That’s where Deep Funding comes in. This mini-contest from deepfunding.org is a special new year’s initiative to replicate judgments from real-world funding decisions. By drawing on data from past grant rounds—across platforms like Open Collective, Gitcoin, and Optimism—participants will explore how open-source repositories have been funded relative to one another in practice. The ultimate goal is a mechanism that can accurately predict the amount of funding a project would have received if they took part in a round, without them actually participating in it.



Although it’s called a “mini-contest,” the stakes are anything but small. With $20,000 in prizes available from Vitalik Buterin, this challenge rewards novel approaches and creative solutions that can inform the design of more robust funding methods for open-source communities. It also serves as a testbed for the main contest—scheduled to open in February—that will apply your model on a larger scale to allocate $170,000 across thousands of Ethereum-related projects.



By participating in this mini-contest, you’re helping to shape the Ethereum community and decide which projects should get funded and for how much. Beyond the immediate prizes or glory, your work could influence a broad, transparent, and inclusive system where dedicated open-source contributors get the resources they need—without endless campaigning or gatekeeping. If you’re intrigued by the chance to make a real difference in the open-source ecosystem, join us in this exciting endeavor to explore new frontiers in collaborative funding.



Below are the key logistic information for the competition:

The submission phase of this competition ends on February 14th, 11:59:59 AoE. During this period, you may submit your model results up to 3 times per day. Your submitted scores will be matched against data kept private to rank your model on a leaderboard.

Before the submission portal closes, you must submit your best model result. The records in your final submission will be used to determine the final score. You also need to submit either your notebook, your code, or a post in the discussion section on the approach you took in building out your model.

The final ranking will be determined by both evaluation scores and assessments on the following dimensions:

Mathematical Consistency

A key requirement is that your model must avoid transitivity violations (e.g., A<B and B<C must imply A<C).

Models that violate these basic logical checks may be disqualified or ranked lower.

Novelty and Approach

Although quantitative metrics are used, this competition specifically rewards unique and valuable approaches to distilling human judgment.

Open-source submissions, additional datasets, and infrastructure that benefit the community may be favored during final assessments. For this reason, posting the secret sauce behind your model early (rather than towards the end) will be prioritized in prize distribution.

Prizes are decided by a jury based on not just model fitting and leaderboard position but also the approach taken in calculating weights, datasets made public and infrastructure valuable for other participants that is shared on the discussion forum. Be sure to submit all relevant code and supporting materials to allow for a thorough evaluation of your approach.
